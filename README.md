## Running in Local Machine
IF you want to run this app in your local machine, all you need to do is just simply clone this repository in your machine then run this in your terminal (ofcourse open your project directory) `yarn add` if you use `npm`, then change the `yarn.lock` to `package-lock.json` then run `npm i`. At last, just simply run `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Construction of this Application
This application was made with ReactJS and SASS(SCSS). I used `react-router-dom` to handle routing in this application. Usee json file to handle fetch requests using map filter. 

## My Plan while building 
First of all I started with `npx create-react-app` ,then modifying files. Then buiding Pages and installing dependencies. Then adding styles. Then making it responsive and fetching data from a separate json file. Finally, fixing Bugs  

## Before publishing to surge, remember to :

- Rename `build\index.html` to `build\200.html`
- Add `\build\` to project path
